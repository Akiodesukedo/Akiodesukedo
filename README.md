### Projects
GlucoFit(https://github.com/IshiHisashi/GlucoFit)
This is an iOS mobile app that helps people with diabetes and pre-diabetic conditions by automatic logging, personalized insights, and gamification.
The development process required an integration of a third party blood glucose level taking device. And I was in charge of not only front-end but also the integration part as well.
